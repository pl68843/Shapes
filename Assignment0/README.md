Getting the feel of java. It's important to understand the components that make up java. In this assignment, we undertake a brief review of how
the class system works in java - include the important system of inheritance. Our job is to create classes of shapes that inherit from a 
root class named Shape.

# Icebreaker
Good start to the semester, especially for those who don't work with java much(me). I had to play around with the super keyword a bunch until I had
an Ah-haa moment. Also since I'm not used to java, it took me alittle to get a project actually up and running. Getting a Java app started is a whole
lot more involved than say a python script. All of these extentions don't work well together and the IDE is reading all sorts of errors... frustrating!
